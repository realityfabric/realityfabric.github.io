About a week ago I remembered that I pay for a domain.

I tried to set up a website with the company I lease my domain through,
but after building the site I was informed that I would have to pay $45
to actually host the site.

Rest In Peace.

Despite that frustration, I still had this domain, and I still wanted
to set up a website.

So here we are. I've spent about 3 hours today studying Liquid (or
whatever form of Ruby it is that Jekyll runs), and I've got a basic
site set up. I'll be tinkering on it throughout this quarter, and
hopefully by the time I graduate (this summer) it should look halfway
decent.
